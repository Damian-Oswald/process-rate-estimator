    "text": "2.2 Installation of the R package PRE\nAll functions that are used repeatedly throughout this projec are implemented in an R package called PRE. The source code of this package is stored in a publically accessible way on GitHub. You can install the package directly from GitHub using the install_github function from the remotes package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"https://github.com/Damian-Oswald/PRE\")\n\nAlternatively, you could download the GitHub repository and manually install the PRE package locally. Once the package is installed, you can attach it to the search path in the usual way.\n\nlibrary(PRE)\n\n\nWhat do the various functions do?\nThe R code shown on this project help page is extremely simplified. If you want want to understand what a specific function of the PRE package does, simple visit the corresponding R help page. For example, you could read on the function crossValidate by using one of the the following commands.\n\nhelp(\"crossValidate\", package = \"PRE\")\n?crossValidate\n\nIf you want to jump really deep into a function, you could print it out in your console.\n\nprint(crossValidate)\n\nfunction (FUN, x, y, k = nrow(x), r = 1, ...) \n{\n    results &lt;- data.frame()\n    for (R in 1:r) {\n        I &lt;- matrix(c(sample(1:nrow(x)), rep(NA, k - nrow(x)%%k)), \n            ncol = k, byrow = TRUE)\n        for (K in 1:k) {\n            i &lt;- na.omit(I[, K])\n            result &lt;- cbind(cost = FUN(x_train = x[-i, ], y_train = y[-i, \n                ], x_test = x[i, ], y_test = y[i, ], ...), r = R, \n                k = K)\n            results &lt;- rbind(results, result)\n        }\n    }\n    return(results)\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x7fc999f2af10&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:PRE&gt;\n\n\nNote this function source code output is lacking any comments. Those were automatically removed when compiling the R package. To see the commented source code, you’ll have to jump into the package files, or visit the GitHub page. Simply use the following URL:\nhttps://github.com/Damian-Oswald/PRE/blob/main/R/crossValidate.R\nNotice how the base name (the last part of the URL) matches the function name. You can replace that by any function name of your liking.",

A non-weighted lysimeter is a device to measure the amount of water that drains through soil, and to determine the types and amounts of dissolved nutrients or contaminants in the water. Each lysimeter had five sampling ports with soil moisture probes and custom-built pore gas sample, at depths of 7.5, 30, 60, 90 and 120 cm below soil surface.\n\\[4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 161 = 9660 \\tag{3.1}\\]\nEquation 3.1 shows how many observations we should expect to have.

This is a necessary step, because the process rate estimator requires these variables.\nSince both N2ONvolume as well as N2ONarea are dependent on initial parameters, their computation is part of the workflow and might change slightly for a changed experimental set-up or different assumptions regarding the environment.\nThe volumetric N2O-N is calculated from the N2O concentration (Equation 3.2).\n\\[\\text N_2 \\text {O-N}_\\text{volume} =  \\frac{28[\\text{N}_2\\text O]}{\\text {R} \\cdot \\text {T}} \\tag{3.2}\\]\nHere, \\(\\text {R}\\) is the gas constant and \\(T\\) is the temperature.

    "text": "3.3 Interpolating the measurements\nThe N2O concentration, site preference as well as \\(\\delta\\)18O are estimated as a function of time for every depth and every column, separately. To achieve this function approximation, Kernel Regression as implemented in npreg is used (Hayfield and Racine 2008). The model requires a single parameter, the bandwidth (bws), which defines how flexible it is. However, the bandwidth needs to be actively chosen and cannot be intrinsically estimated – it’s a hypertuning parameter a.k.a. a hyperparameter.\n\nChoosing optimal bandwidths for the interpolation\nFigure 3.1 gives an intuitive understanding on why we don’t want to use the same bandwidth for every single combination of depth and column: In some instances we seem to have a very clear signal, while in others, there seems to be much noise – we are dealing with unequal variance, a.k.a. heteroskedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Animated explanation on two examplary subsets of the data. On the left, there is a very high sinal to noise ratio, thus the optimal bandwith hyperparameter will be smaller than on the right.\n\n\n\nThe bandwidth hyperparameter is individually tuned using 3-fold 10 times repeated cross-validation for every combination of column and depth and variable1, respectively. You can see an overview of the found hyperparameters in figure 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.\n1 I.e. the three variables N2O concentration, site preference and \\(\\delta\\)18O.\n\nN2O concentrationSite preferenceStable isotope ratio (\\(\\delta\\)18O)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Optimal hyperparameter size by depth and column for the N2O-N concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Optimal hyperparameter size by depth and column for the site preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Optimal hyperparameter size by depth and column for the stable isotope ratio \\(\\delta\\)18O concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, smaller bandwidths correspond to a more flexible model, indicating a larger signal-to-noise ratio. Notice how deeper measurements seem to correspond to smaller bandwidths, at least for the N2O concentration and the stable isotope ratio (\\(\\delta\\)18O). Note that the optimal bandwidths for N2O are also used for the interpolation of N2O-Nvolume and N2O-Narea.\n\n\nNumerical approximation of the derivative estimation\nWith the optimized hyperparameters, we are all set to estimate the functions over time, as well as their derivatives, which are needed for the process rate estimator.\nOne common way to numerically approximate the derivative of a function \\(f\\) at a point \\(t\\) is through the central difference method. This method computes the average rate of change over a small interval around the point of interest.\n\\[\\frac{df}{dt} \\approx \\frac{f(t + h) - f(t - h)}{2h} \\tag{3.4}\\]\nHere, \\(h\\) is a small positive number known as the step size. The notations \\(f(t + h)\\) and \\(f(t - h)\\) represent the function values at \\(t + h\\) and \\(t - h\\), respectively. The smaller h is, the more accurate the approximation should be. However, if h is too small, then round-off errors from computer arithmetic can become significant. So, an appropriate balance must be struck. The central difference method is implemented as the fderiv function in the pracma R package.\nBoth the function estimation as well as the estimation of the derivative are performed with a single function call in the R package PRE.\n\ndata &lt;- getMissing(data = data, hyperparameters = PRE::hyperparameters)\n\nHere, data is the data frame that we slightly extended with the getN2ON function. The object hyperparameters is a three-dimensional array containing the optimized hyperparameters for this project. It is also included in the PRE package2.\n2 To optimize the hyperparameters, you can run the R script hypertuning.R.",

    "text": "6.4 Emulation of the model outputs\nTo conduct the sensitivity analysis, we now model the results based on the sampled parameters – so we treat the sampled parameters as independent variables \\(\\mathbf X\\), and the computed mean process rates over time as dependent variables \\(\\mathbf Y\\).\nA commonly applied method of sensitivity analysis is Sobol’s method, which decomposes the total variance and assigns it to individual parameters specific interactions (Sobol’ 1990). However, Sobol’s method requires a large number of resampling, and is thus unfit for this application, because every model run is rather expensive. Instead, a linear regression model is used as an emulator. Often, this works fine enough because even though the response might not be linear overall, it can be approximated well enough by a linear model on a specific parameter interval.\nFirst, we might look at the pairwise correlations between columns of \\(\\mathbf X\\) and \\(\\mathbf Y\\), i.e. all combinations of process rates as well as bulk density and isotope end members (Figure 6.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Pairwise results of the process rates (y-axis) and the isotope end members (x-axis) for column 1 at 7.5 cm depth. To evaluate the results of other depth-column combinations, visit the respective GitHub repository site. The red lines indicate the respective linear models with their 95% conficence intervals. The black bar to the right of each plot represents the magnitude of the absolute standardized regression coefficient (SRC). The absolute SRC can range from 0 to 1, where an SRC of 1 would range the entire plot plane. As such, these bars represent the importance of a given parameter for emulating the respective process.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 already reveals quite a lot, but in order to quantify the individual effects, it would be better to construct a multivariate linear regression model where we include all isotope end members at the same time.\n\\[\\mathbf Y = \\mathbf X \\mathbf B + \\mathbf U \\tag{6.1}\\]\nFor further analysis, we are interested in the coefficients \\(\\mathbf B\\) of this multivariate linear model, not its predictions. Individual coefficients will be referred to as \\(\\beta_i\\). Note that ever though an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) is included in these models, it is not interesting and thus will be excluded from further analyses.\nA model as specified in Equation 6.1 is fit for every combination of depth and column separately. Thus, this leads to repeated coefficient estimates for each parameter (or variable, in this context).",

    "text": "6.5 Estimate parameter contributions to the output variance\nIn this section, the focus is on interpreting the raw coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) derived from the set of linear regression models that were fit in the last section. These coefficients provide a numerical representation of the influence each parameter has on the process rate estimates.\n\nLooking at the raw coefficients\nEach coefficient \\(\\beta_i\\) represents the change in the output variable for a one-unit change in the parameter, holding all other parameters constant. This allows us to directly assess the sensitivity of the model to changes in each specific parameter.\nBy reviewing the coefficients in table 6.2, we can identify which parameters are more influential and may thus deserve further attention to reduce uncertainty in the process rate estimator.\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Coefficients (\\(\\mu\\) ± \\(\\sigma\\)) for the models fit on combinations of depth and column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrification\nDenitrification\nReduction\n\n\n\n\nBulk density\n-21 ± 31\n2.3 ± 40\n45 ± 65\n\n\n\\(\\eta\\;\\text{SP}_{\\text{diffusion}}\\)\n0.74 ± 1.2\n-0.35 ± 0.61\n0.055 ± 0.54\n\n\n\\(\\eta^{18}\\text{O}_\\text{diffusion}\\)\n-0.25 ± 0.61\n-0.65 ± 1.2\n-0.088 ± 1.1\n\n\n\\(\\text{SP}_\\text{nitrification}\\)\n-0.17 ± 0.4\n0.13 ± 0.25\n0.094 ± 0.13\n\n\n\\(\\delta\\;^18\\text{O}_\\text{nitrification}\\)\n0.089 ± 0.23\n0.056 ± 0.17\n-0.12 ± 0.26\n\n\n\\(\\text{SP}_\\text{denitrification}\\)\n-0.42 ± 0.18\n0.23 ± 0.094\n-0.014 ± 0.13\n\n\n\\(\\delta\\;^18\\text{O}_\\text{denitrification}\\)\n0.15 ± 0.085\n0.29 ± 0.21\n-0.14 ± 0.23\n\n\n\\(\\eta\\;\\text{SP}_{\\text{reduction}}\\)\n0.76 ± 0.39\n-0.42 ± 0.18\n0.016 ± 0.26\n\n\n\\(\\eta^{18}\\text{O}_\\text{reduction}\\)\n-0.31 ± 0.2\n-0.47 ± 0.33\n0.29 ± 0.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadjusted R2\n0.95 ± 0.043\n0.94 ± 0.057\n0.92 ± 0.091\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen interpreting the raw coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) in the regression models used in the sensitivity analysis, it’s important to note that these coefficients reflect the effect size of each parameter at a fixed value, assuming other parameters are held constant. However, these coefficients do not take into account the prior uncertainty associated with each parameter listed in table 6.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Results of the coefficients for all processes and parameters. The mangitude of the coefficients can be interpreted as the effect size said parameter would have without considering its uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that while a coefficient can indicate how much the output will change with a one-unit change in the parameter, it doesn’t take into account the uncertainty of the parameter itself, which is also a driver of the overall contribution to the model sensitivity. In order to consider the actual contribution of parameters to the model outcome variability, looking at the standardized regression coefficient is more appropriate.\n\n\nStandardized regression coefficients\nThe standardized regression coefficient (SRC, \\(\\beta^\\ast\\)), often referred to as beta coefficient in statistical models, measures the strength and direction of the relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable in a regression model, with all variables being standardized. The SRC can be calculated as:\n\\[\\beta^\\ast_i = \\frac{\\sigma_{x_i}}{\\sigma_y} \\beta_i \\tag{6.2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_i\\) is the estimated coefficient of a predictor \\(x_i\\) in a linear model, \\(\\sigma_{x_i}\\) is the predictor’s standard deviation, while \\(\\sigma_{y}\\) is the response’s standard deviation. A consequence of standardizing the coefficients is that they all fall into the range between -1 and 1.\nThe key advantage of using standardized regression coefficients is that it allows for direct comparison of the relative importance or impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable across different studies or models, even when the variables are measured on different scales. This enables a clearer understanding of which variables have the most significant influence on the outcome, making it a useful tool for a sensitivity analysis. Now, the value assigned to each parameter represents its relative importance (Table 6.3).\n\n\n\nTable 6.3: Standardized regression coefficients (\\(\\mu\\) ± \\(\\sigma\\)) for the models fit on combinations of depth and column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrification\n\nDenitrification\n\nReduction\n\n\n\n\n\nBulk density\n-0.31 ± 0.27\n(12%)\n0.064 ± 0.41\n(0.64%)\n0.51 ± 0.44\n(50%)\n\n\n\\(\\eta\\;\\text{SP}_{\\text{diffusion}}\\)\n0.048 ± 0.056\n(0.28%)\n-0.023 ± 0.031\n(0.079%)\n0.0026 ± 0.026\n(0.0012%)\n\n\n\\(\\eta^{18}\\text{O}_\\text{diffusion}\\)\n-0.013 ± 0.024\n(0.02%)\n-0.033 ± 0.052\n(0.17%)\n-0.0045 ± 0.061\n(0.0038%)\n\n\n\\(\\text{SP}_\\text{nitrification}\\)\n-0.062 ± 0.077\n(0.47%)\n0.06 ± 0.08\n(0.55%)\n0.037 ± 0.034\n(0.26%)\n\n\n\\(\\delta\\;^18\\text{O}_\\text{nitrification}\\)\n0.047 ± 0.057\n(0.26%)\n0.035 ± 0.091\n(0.19%)\n-0.075 ± 0.11\n(1.1%)\n\n\n\\(\\text{SP}_\\text{denitrification}\\)\n-0.57 ± 0.15\n(39%)\n0.27 ± 0.11\n(12%)\n-0.023 ± 0.1\n(0.1%)\n\n\n\\(\\delta\\;^18\\text{O}_\\text{denitrification}\\)\n0.12 ± 0.057\n(1.9%)\n0.2 ± 0.082\n(6.5%)\n-0.12 ± 0.14\n(2.6%)\n\n\n\\(\\eta\\;\\text{SP}_{\\text{reduction}}\\)\n0.32 ± 0.16\n(12%)\n-0.16 ± 0.086\n(4.2%)\n0.014 ± 0.052\n(0.039%)\n\n\n\\(\\eta^{18}\\text{O}_\\text{reduction}\\)\n-0.48 ± 0.25\n(28%)\n-0.67 ± 0.36\n(71%)\n0.45 ± 0.43\n(38%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadjusted R2\n0.95 ± 0.043\n\n0.94 ± 0.057\n\n0.92 ± 0.091\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardizing the coefficients changes the results seen in table 6.2 and figure 6.2. Note that the coefficients of column, depth and their interactions are excluded from this table, even though they are more explanatory than the isotope end members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Results of the standardized regression coefficients (SRC) for all processes and parameters. The mangitude of the SRC can be interpreted as the effect size of said parameter: by how much does its uncertainty contribute to the overall uncertainty?\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation of standard regression coefficients is not quite straightforward – remember; standard deviations are not cumulative, only variance is. So, to indicate proportional share of explained variance, the squared SRC would need to be compared.\n\n\nVariance decomposition\nSquaring the standardized regression coefficient is related to the variance decomposition performed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA), which was developed and formally described by Ronald A. Fisher (Fisher 1926, Fisher 1935). In the absence of multicollinearity, the expected values of both the ANOVA relative sum of squares and the squared SRC are the same (Novak 2015). However, the ANOVA has the nice property that the assigned variance explained matches the overall goodness of fit (R2) of the models perfectly. Thus, the final variance decomposition is computed from a classical multi-way ANOVA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Overall results of the sensitivity analysis. The three show the share of variance explained by each parameter, calculated from the absolute standardized regression coefficients. Note that linear models did not explain the variance equally well for all three processes. The hatched area represents the variance unexplained by the linear models computed as the residual relative sum of squares (1 - R2).\n\n\n\nThe results shown in figure 6.4 allow us to assign percentage-wise contributions to the variance explained to the individual parameters inspected during the sensitivity analysis. Averaged over all processes, \\(\\eta\\ce{^{18}O_\\text{reduction}}\\) contributes most to the variance in the processes (40.9%), followed by the bulk density (26.3%) and \\(\\text{SP}_\\text{denitrification}\\) (14.3%). All other parameters combined only explain little variance (12.2%). Also, on average, 6.3% of the variance is left unexplained by the linear models.\nThe source of the unexplained variance in figure 6.4 may be attributed to one of two sources: either it stems from the variance of the process rate estimate themselves, or from a non-linear response of the mean process rate estimates to changes in the parameters. The results in table 6.4 seem to suggest that at least some of the variance (between 0.46% and 1.04% percentage points, as SAMPLEREPEAT = 15 was used for the sensitivity analysis) stems from the inherent uncertainty of the process rate estimator itself. That would translate to little more than 10% of the unexplained variance as it is determined by the ANOVA.\n\n\n\nTable 6.4: Results showing the effect of the SAMPLEREPEAT parameter in the longPRE function on the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for mean nitrification, denitrification, and reduction processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAMPLEREPEAT\nMetric\nNitrification\nDenitrification\nReduction\n\n\n\n\n5\nMean\nStandard deviation\nCoefficient of variation\n13.784\n0.129\n0.94%\n14.172\n0.198\n1.40%\n26.633\n0.584\n2.19%\n\n\n15\nMean\nStandard deviation\nCoefficient of variation\n13.818\n0.063\n0.46%\n14.234\n0.094\n0.66%\n26.821\n0.279\n1.04%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot every parameter explains the variance in the process rate estimates equally well for different processes. For example, the variance in the estimated reduction rates are reasonably well explained (83.7%) only by bulk density and \\(\\eta\\ce{^{18}O_\\text{reduction}}\\) alone. Bulk density seems much less capable in explaining the variance in the estimated nitrification and denitrification rates, on the other hand. For these two processes, \\(\\text{SP}_\\text{denitrification}\\) and \\(\\eta\\ce{^{18}O_\\text{reduction}}\\) seem to be the more driving factors.\n\n\n\n\nBorgonovo, E., and E. Plischke. 2016.
