The latter is called total denitrification — the full process described in Equation 2.1 takes place.\n\\[\n\\ce{NO3^- -&gt;[\\text{Nitrate}][\\text{reductase}] NO2^- -&gt;[\\text{Nitrite}][\\text{reductase}] NO -&gt;[\\text{Nitrite oxide}][\\text{reductase}] N2O^- -&gt;[\\text{Nitrous oxide}][\\text{reductase}] N2}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nDenitrification occurs in conditions where oxygen is limited, such as waterlogged soils. It is part of the nitrogen cycle, where nitrogen is circulated between the atmosphere, organisms and the earth."

    "text": "2.2 Installation of the R package PRE\nAll functions that are used repeatedly throughout this projec are implemented in an R package called PRE. The source code of this package is stored in a publically accessible way on GitHub. You can install the package directly from GitHub using the install_github function from the remotes package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"https://github.com/Damian-Oswald/PRE\")\n\nAlternatively, you could download the GitHub repository and manually install the PRE package locally. Once the package is installed, you can attach it to the search path in the usual way.\n\nlibrary(PRE)\n\n\n2.2.1 What do the various functions do?\nThe R code shown on this project help page is extremely simplified. If you want want to understand what a specific function of the PRE package does, simple visit the corresponding R help page. For example, you could read on the function crossValidate by using one of the the following commands.\n\nhelp(\"crossValidate\", package = \"PRE\")\n?crossValidate\n\nIf you want to jump really deep into a function, you could print it out in your console.\n\nprint(crossValidate)\n\nfunction (FUN, x, y, k = nrow(x), r = 1, hyperparameter = NULL) \n{\n    results &lt;- data.frame()\n    for (R in 1:r) {\n        I &lt;- matrix(c(sample(1:nrow(x)), rep(NA, k - nrow(x)%%k)), \n            ncol = k, byrow = TRUE)\n        for (K in 1:k) {\n            i &lt;- na.omit(I[, K])\n            result &lt;- cbind(cost = FUN(x_train = x[-i, ], y_train = y[-i, \n                ], x_test = x[i, ], y_test = y[i, ], hyperparameter = hyperparameter), \n                r = R, k = K)\n            results &lt;- rbind(results, result)\n        }\n    }\n    return(results)\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x7f9f531c6640&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:PRE&gt;\n\n\nNote this function source code output is lacking any comments. Those were automatically removed when compiling the R package. To see the commented source code, you’ll have to jump into the package files, or visit the GitHub page. Simply use the following URL:\nhttps://github.com/Damian-Oswald/PRE/blob/main/R/crossValidate.R\nNotice how the base name (the last part of the URL) matches the function name. You can replace that by any function name of your liking."

The experiment was set up as a randomized complete block design, with 4 varieties and 3 replicates, using 12 non-weighted lysimeters. A non-weighted lysimeter is a device to measure the amount of water that drains through soil, and to determine the types and amounts of dissolved nutrients or contaminants in the water. Each lysimeter had five sampling ports with soil moisture probes and custom-built pore gas sample, at depths of 7.5, 30, 60, 90 and 120 cm below soil surface.\n\\[4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 161 = 9660 \\tag{3.1}\\]\nEquation 3.1 shows how many observations we should expect to have. In reality, some observations are missing. Hence, the measurements data frame only includes 9558 rows, with 9 variables.

Alternatively, the data can be directly accessed as PRE::measurements (the prefix PRE:: tells R that the object can be found in the PRE package.)\nYou can see an interactive overview of the measurements data in the column below. For many dates, there are no measurements of \\(\\ce{N2O}\\), site preference, or \\(\\delta^{18}\\text{O}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, the measurements for N2O concentration, site preference as well as \\(\\delta\\)18O are distributed more or less evenly over time. Hence, we’ll interpolate the missing values. This step will be the focus of the next section."

    "text": "3.2 Calculating volumetric and area N2O-N\nIn a first step, we are calculating the N2O-N per volume and subsequently per area. This is a necessary step, because the process rate estimator requires these variables.\nSince both N2ONvolume as well as N2ONarea are dependent on initial parameters, their computation is part of the workflow and might change slightly for a changed experimental set-up or different assumptions regarding the environment.\nThe volumetric N2O-N is calculated from the N2O concentration (Equation 3.2).\n\\[\\text N_2 \\text {O-N}_\\text{volume} =  \\frac{28[\\text{N}_2\\text O]}{\\text {R} \\cdot \\text {T}} \\tag{3.2}\\]\nHere, \\(\\text {R}\\) is the gas constant and \\(T\\) is the temperature. In a next step, we calculate the per-area N2O-N from the volumetric N2O-N and the soil moisture as well as the total porosity and the increment in meters.\n\\[\\text N_2 \\text {O-N}_\\text{area} = \\text N_2 \\text {O-N}_\\text{volume} \\times \\frac{1}{100} \\texttt{increment} \\times \\frac{10^4}{10^3} \\left(\\theta_t - \\texttt{moisture} \\right) \\tag{3.3}\\]\nAll of these equations are implemented in the getN2ON function. This function returns a data frame very similar to measurements, but with two extra columns for the computed N2ONvolume and N2ONarea variables.\n\ndata &lt;- getN2ON(data = PRE::measurements, parameters = getParameters())\n\nNote that the getParameters function simply returns a list with the default values for all necessary parameters such as the gas constant \\(\\text R\\) or the assumed air temperature \\(\\text T\\). If we wish to change these, we can pass alternative parameter values to the function. For example, we could assume an air temperature of 300 K with getParameters(temperature = 300). This makes sure that depended parameter values are updated as well."

    "text": "3.3 Interpolating the measurements\nThe N2O concentration, site preference as well as \\(\\delta\\)18O are estimated as a function of time for every depth and every column, separately. To achieve this function approximation, Kernel Regression as implemented in npreg is used (Hayfield and Racine 2008). The model requires a single parameter, the bandwidth (bws), which defines how flexible it is. However, the bandwidth needs to be actively chosen and cannot be intrinsically estimated – it’s a hypertuning parameter a.k.a. a hyperparameter.\n\n3.3.1 Choosing optimal bandwidths for the interpolation\nFigure 3.1 gives an intuitive understanding on why we don’t want to use the same bandwidth for every single combination of depth and column: In some instances we seem to have a very clear signal, while in others, there seems to be much noise – we are dealing with unequal variance, a.k.a. heteroskedasticity.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Animated explanation on two examplary subsets of the data. On the left, there is a very high sinal to noise ratio, thus the optimal bandwith hyperparameter will be smaller than on the right.\n\n\nThe bandwidth hyperparameter is individually tuned using 3-fold 10 times repeated cross-validation for every combination of column and depth and variable1, respectively. You can see an overview of the found hyperparameters in figure 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.\n\n\nN2O concentrationSite preferenceStable isotope ratio (\\(\\delta\\)18O)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Optimal hyperparameter size by depth and column for the N2O-N concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Optimal hyperparameter size by depth and column for the site preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Optimal hyperparameter size by depth and column for the stable isotope ratio \\(\\delta\\)18O concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, smaller bandwidths correspond to a more flexible model, indicating a larger signal-to-noise ratio. Notice how deeper measurements seem to correspond to smaller bandwidths, at least for the N2O concentration and the stable isotope ratio (\\(\\delta\\)18O). Note that the optimal bandwidths for N2O are also used for the interpolation of N2O-Nvolume and N2O-Narea.\n\n\n3.3.2 Numerical approximation of the derivative estimation\nWith the optimized hyperparameters, we are all set to estimate the functions over time, as well as their derivatives, which are needed for the process rate estimator.\nOne common way to numerically approximate the derivative of a function \\(f\\) at a point \\(t\\) is through the central difference method. This method computes the average rate of change over a small interval around the point of interest.\n\\[\\frac{df}{dt} \\approx \\frac{f(t + h) - f(t - h)}{2h} \\tag{3.4}\\]\nHere, \\(h\\) is a small positive number known as the step size. The notations \\(f(t + h)\\) and \\(f(t - h)\\) represent the function values at \\(t + h\\) and \\(t - h\\), respectively. The smaller h is, the more accurate the approximation should be. However, if h is too small, then round-off errors from computer arithmetic can become significant. So, an appropriate balance must be struck. The central difference method is implemented as the fderiv function in the pracma R package.\nBoth the function estimation as well as the estimation of the derivative are performed with a single function call in the R package PRE.\n\ndata &lt;- getMissing(data = data, hyperparameters = PRE::hyperparameters)\n\nHere, data is the data frame that we slightly extended with the getN2ON function. The object hyperparameters is a three-dimensional array containing the optimized hyperparameters for this project. It is also included in the PRE package2."

We’ll have to specify how many times we want to do this — in this example that’s n = 200.\n\nn &lt;- 200\nparameters &lt;- data.frame(eta_SP_diffusion = rnorm(n, 1.55, 0.28),\n                         eta_18O_diffusion = rnorm(n, -7.79, 0.27),\n                         SP_nitrification = runif(n, 26.2, 34.6),\n                         d18O_nitrification = rnorm(n, 36.5, 2),\n                         SP_denitrification = runif(n, -2.4, -0.9),\n                         d18O_denitrification = rnorm(n,11.1, 2),\n                         eta_SP_reduction = runif(n,-8,-2),\n                         eta_18O_reduction = runif(n,-24,-6))\n\nNext, we write a function f that will run the process rate estimator for a specified column and depth with the parameters in the vector p — which coincides to one row in the parameters data frame.\n\nf &lt;- function(p, data, column = 1, depth = 7.5) {\n    x &lt;- longPRE(data = data,\n                 column = column,\n                 depth = depth,\n                 n = 3,\n                 parameters = do.call(getParameters, as.list(p)))\n    return(x[[\"processes\"]])\n}\n\nThat function makes it very straightforward to compute the data for the sensitivity analysis. We’ll simply apply f to every single row in parameters using the apply function (Wickham 2011).\n\nresults &lt;- t(apply(parameters, 1, f, data = data, column = 1, depth = 7.5))\n\nTo conduct the sensitivity analysis, we now model the results based on the sampled parameters – so we treat the sampled parameters as independent variables \\(\\mathbf X\\), and the computed process rates as dependent variables \\(\\mathbf Y\\).\nA commonly applied method of sensitivity analysis is Sobol’s method, which decomposes the total variance and assigns it to individual parameters specific interactions (Sobol’ 1990). However, Sobol’s method require’s a large number of resampling, and is thus unfit for this application. Instead, a linear regression model is used as an emulator. Often, this works fine enough because even though the reponse might not be linear overall, it can be approximated by a linear model well enough on a specific parameter interval.\nFirst, we might look at the pairwise correlations between columns of \\(\\mathbf X\\) and \\(\\mathbf Y\\), i.e. all combinations of process rates as well as isotope end members (Figure 6.1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Pairwise results of the process rates (y-axis) and the isotope end members (x-axis) for column 1 at 7.5 cm depth. The red lines indicate the respective linear models with their 95% conficence intervals. The black bar to the right of each plot represents the magnitude of the absolute standardized regression coefficient (SRC). The absolute SRC can range from 0 to 1, where an SRC of 1 would range the entire plot plane. As such, these bars represent the importance of a given parameter for emulating the respective process.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 already reveals quite a lot, but it would be better to construct a multiple linear regression model where we include all isotope end members at the same time.\nThe table below shows the resulting coefficients of such a multiple linear regression model. We can directly interpret the regression coefficients without any further modifications, as all considered variables share the same unit (‰).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrification\n\n\nDenitrification\n\n\nReduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neta_SP_diffusion\n\n\n1.694***\n\n\n-0.661***\n\n\n-0.697***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.112)\n\n\n(0.078)\n\n\n(0.091)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neta_18O_diffusion\n\n\n-0.850***\n\n\n-0.589***\n\n\n0.631***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.118)\n\n\n(0.082)\n\n\n(0.096)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSP_nitrification\n\n\n-0.800***\n\n\n0.323***\n\n\n0.362***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.013)\n\n\n(0.009)\n\n\n(0.011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd18O_nitrification\n\n\n0.459***\n\n\n0.179***\n\n\n-0.408***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.015)\n\n\n(0.011)\n\n\n(0.013)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSP_denitrification\n\n\n-0.796***\n\n\n0.292***\n\n\n0.266***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.073)\n\n\n(0.051)\n\n\n(0.060)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd18O_denitrification\n\n\n0.371***\n\n\n0.288***\n\n\n-0.388***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.016)\n\n\n(0.011)\n\n\n(0.013)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neta_SP_reduction\n\n\n1.178***\n\n\n-0.327***\n\n\n-0.164***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.018)\n\n\n(0.013)\n\n\n(0.015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neta_18O_reduction\n\n\n-0.532***\n\n\n-0.451***\n\n\n0.433***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.006)\n\n\n(0.004)\n\n\n(0.005)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n4.867***\n\n\n-14.110***\n\n\n44.180***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.197)\n\n\n(0.834)\n\n\n(0.978)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n500\n\n\n500\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.972\n\n\n0.966\n\n\n0.954\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.971\n\n\n0.965\n\n\n0.953\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

    "text": "6.2 Using a mixed effects model as an emulator\nA mixed effects model is a statistical model containing both fixed effects and random effects. In matrix notation, a linear mixed effects model can be represented as follows. \\[\n\\mathbf y = \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\mathbf Z \\boldsymbol \\zeta  + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon\n\\tag{6.1}\\] In this notation, \\(\\mathbf y\\) is a known vector of obervations, where \\(\\mathbb E (\\mathbf y) = \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta\\). Unlike in the OLS model, the errors of this mixed effects model are derived from two sources: on one hand from the error vector \\(\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon\\), but on the other hand also from the random effects \\(\\mathbf Z \\boldsymbol \\zeta\\), where we have both \\(\\mathbb E (\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon) = \\mathbf 0\\) and \\(\\mathbb E (\\boldsymbol \\zeta) = \\mathbf 0\\). So, generally, the expected error in the model is still zero. However, by use of the term \\(\\mathbf Z \\boldsymbol \\zeta\\), errors might be clustered into groups, where \\(\\mathbf Z\\) is a design matrix containing information about these groups.\nOne interpretation of the fixed effects coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) is that they are the estimated population means of the coefficient distributions of the random effects coefficients (Bates et al. 2014).\nFor approximating the synthetic data within the scope of the sensitivity analysis, we estimate three mixed effects models – one for Nitrification, Denitrification and Reduction, respectively – with random intercepts and random slopes. Thus, \\(3 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 + 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 = 2928\\) parameters are estimated in total."

Each point represents one mean process rate for a given depth, column and set of randomly drawn parameters according to table 6.1. As to be seen, clusters are formed based on combinations of depth and column. The clusters themselves can each be well described as multivariate Gaussians (colored area). The scatterplots are drawn with constrained x- and y-axis limits (A) and unconstrained ones (B).\n\n\n\nTwo things are striking when looking at the clusters in figure 6.2: Both the within-group variance as well as the total variance (i.e. the variance of the cluster location) seems to be lower for the deeper depths. Additionally, one of the cluster centers constitutes a massive outlier – it’s column 12 at 7.5 cm depth (Figure 6.2 B).\n\n\n\n\nBates, D., M. Mächler, B. Bolker, and S. Walker. 2014.
