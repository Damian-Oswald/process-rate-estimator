\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector with starting values of \code{N2Onit}, \code{N2Oden}, and \code{N2Ored}.}

\item{e}{Vector of the isotope end members.}

\item{fluxes}{Values of \code{N2O}, \code{SP} and \code{d18O} as well as their fluxes from other increments.}

\item{derivatives}{Derivatives of \code{N2O}, \code{SP} and \code{d18O} with respect to time.}
}
\description{
The state equation set are the core of the process rate estimator (PRE).
}
\details{
The state equation set incorporates three distinct equations.
