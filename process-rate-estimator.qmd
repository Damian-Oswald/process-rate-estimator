# Introduction

Denitrification is the natural process by which nitrate (NO~3~^-^) in the soil are converted by bacteria into nitrous oxide (N~2~O) or pure nitrigen (N~2~). The latter is called *total denitrification* --- the full process described in @eq-denitrification takes place.

$$
\ce{NO3^- ->[\text{Nitrate}][\text{reductase}] NO2^- ->[\text{Nitrite}][\text{reductase}] NO ->[\text{Nitrite oxide}][\text{reductase}] N2O^- ->[\text{Nitrous oxide}][\text{reductase}] N2}
$${#eq-denitrification}

Denitrification occurs in conditions where oxygen is limited, such as waterlogged soils. It is part of the nitrogen cycle, where nitrogen is circulated between the atmosphere, organisms and the earth.

# Formal model description

The diffusion fluxes between soil increments are described by Frick's law (@eq-frick).

$$F_{\text{calc}} = \frac{dC}{dZ} D_{\text s} \rho$${#eq-frick}

Here, $D_s$ is the gas diffusion coefficient, $\rho$ is the gas density of N~2~O, and $\frac{dC}{dZ}$ is the N~2~O concentration gradient from lower to upper depth.

The gas diffusion coefficient $D_{\text s}$ was calculated according @eq-MillingtonQuirk as established by Millington and Quirk in 1961 [@millington1961permeability].

$$D_{\text s} = \left( \frac{\theta_w^{\frac{10}{3}} + D_{\text fw}}{H} + \theta_a^{\frac{10}{3}} \times D_{\text fa} \right) \times \theta_T^{-2}$${#eq-MillingtonQuirk}

Here, $H$ represents a dimensionless form of Henry's solubility constant ($H'$) for N~2~O in water at a given temperature. The constant $H$ for N~2~O is calculated as follows:

$$H = \frac{8.5470 \times 10^5 \times \exp \frac{-2284}{\text T}}{\text R \times \text T}$${#eq-H}

Here, $\text R$ is the gas constant, and $\text T$ is the temperature ($\text T = 298 \; \text K$).

$D_{\text{fw}}$ was calculated according to @eq-Dfw as documented by Versteeg and Van Swaaij (1988) [@versteeg1988solubility].

$$D_{\text{fw}} = 5.07 \times 10^{-6} \times \exp \frac{-2371}{\text T}$${#eq-Dfw}
